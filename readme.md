# Setup

You'll need the lat lng coordinates of the location you want to zoom to.

Store those in the locations array in index.js

You'll also need to set the dates object in index.js to show the dates you
want to list. There can be as many as you'd like, but they need to have the form

`{ m: 'month', d: day }`
